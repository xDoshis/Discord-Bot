# Description 
Quickly thrown together project that operates as a communications bot between a MC server and a Discord channel. 

The bot connects to the FTP server that contains all of the MC server logs, downloads the contents, and checks whether new users
have logged on/off, whether a user died in-game, and a couple other fun nicknacks :)
